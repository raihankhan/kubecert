                      If `algorithm` is specified and `size` is not provided,
                      key size of 2048 will be used for `RSA` key algorithm and

                      If provided, allowed values are `PKCS1` and `PKCS8` standing for PKCS#1

                      will be generated whenever a re-issuance occurs.

                      and will default to `256` if not specified.
                      If `algorithm` is set to
